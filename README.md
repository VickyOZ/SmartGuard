- Transparent and decentralized operations
- Built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts

## Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) for Clarity smart contract development and testing
- Basic understanding of blockchain technology and smart contracts

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decensure.git
   cd smart-guard
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up Clarinet for local development:
   ```
   clarinet new
   ```

## Usage

1. Deploy the smart contract to the Stacks blockchain (testnet or mainnet) using the Stacks CLI or Clarinet.

2. Interact with the contract using the provided functions:

   - `initialize`: Set up the contract (owner only)
   - `create-pool`: Create a new insurance pool
   - `join-pool`: Join an existing insurance pool
   - `file-claim`: Submit an insurance claim
   - `process-claim`: Approve or reject a claim (owner only)
   - `get-pool-info`: Retrieve information about a specific pool
   - `get-claim-info`: Get details of a particular claim

## Smart Contract Overview

The main smart contract (`decentralized-insurance.clar`) includes the following key components:

- Data maps for storing pool and claim information
- Public functions for creating pools, joining pools, and filing claims
- Admin functions for initializing the contract and processing claims
- Read-only functions for retrieving pool and claim data

For a detailed breakdown of each function, please refer to the comments in the smart contract file.
